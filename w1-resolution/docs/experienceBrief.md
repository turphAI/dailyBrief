# Resolution tracker experience
Turph's Resulutions should be the app title

## Problems
Problems with resolutions. So, in no particular order:
- I am inherently lazy
- I forget about resolutions because life is busy
- I have too many resolutions
- Resolutions are not measurable

## Outcomes
What I expect to achieve with the web application experience

### Resolution
*Count* Cap at 5 active resolutions. Once the limit is reached any ui element or conversational intents asking to create a new one should not work. Only active resolutions count towards the cap, completed or Deleted resolutions do not.

*State* Resolutions should be active by default until they are deemed Complete by the user.

*Creation* The AI needs to allow but challenge the creation of new resolutions. Resolutions need to be realistic, achievable and measurable. The creation of new resolutions should only happen through the conversational interface and not through form elements in supporting experience elements of the ui.

*Updating* The AI needs to allow but challenge the updating of existing resolutions. Since there will be progress on resolutions making updates to them could cause conflicts

*Deleting* The AI and UI needs to allow and confirm the deletion of an existing resolution. Once deleted, its information and reference can be removed from the data

### Conversational interface
I need an affordance which allows me, through natural language input, to create and engage with my resolution tracking experience.

This ui element should be in the main left side panel of the view which is always visible and available. It should be considered the main interface to the experience, and everything else is playing a supporting role. 

### Structured interface
I need an affordance which allows me to do some work which will not be conversational in nature. More on this to come...

### Rough ui framework
Use the visual of the basic application layout here /Users/turphai/Projects/dailyBrief/w1-resolution/assets/framework.jpg

### Design system themeing
This needs to revert back to the default shadcn Normal look and feel. No more purple.
