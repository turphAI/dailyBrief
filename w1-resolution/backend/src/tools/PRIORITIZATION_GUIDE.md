# Resolution Prioritization Guide

## Overview

The `prioritizeResolutions` tool helps you create a **fluid, adaptive strategy** for managing multiple resolutions without the paralysis of trying to do everything at once.

## The Problem It Solves

When you have 3-5 active resolutions, you face a real challenge:
- ❌ You can't give 100% effort to each one
- ❌ Waterfall approaches (finish one, start next) lead to lost progress
- ❌ Equal time allocation ignores dependencies and focus areas
- ❌ Ignoring some resolutions causes guilt and momentum loss

## The Solution: Tiered, Adaptive Prioritization

### Three-Tier System

#### 1. **Immediate Focus** (5+ hours/week)
Your priority targets for this period. These get your peak energy and focus.

**Characteristics:**
- Aligned with current life focus area
- Frequent commitment (daily or multiple times/week)
- Often have dependencies that support other areas
- Examples: Exercise resolution when focusing on health

**What to do:**
- Schedule specific times
- Track progress closely
- Celebrate wins
- Be flexible if circumstances change

#### 2. **Secondary** (2-5 hours/week)
Important progress, but with less concentrated effort.

**Characteristics:**
- Weekly or bi-weekly commitments
- Support your overall growth
- Less time-intensive than immediate focus
- Examples: Reading goal, skill-building

**What to do:**
- Consistency over perfection
- Build small habits
- Integrate into routine
- Track without obsessing

#### 3. **Maintenance** (1-2 hours/week or 15-30 min touchdowns)
Keep momentum without burning out.

**Characteristics:**
- Low-frequency resolutions
- Can progress slowly
- Important to avoid regression
- Examples: Social connection goal, hobby

**What to do:**
- Monthly or weekly minimal effort
- Just enough to feel progress
- Prevents "falling off" psychologically
- Often shifts up when circumstances allow

### Understanding Dependencies

Some resolutions support others:

```
Health (Exercise) 
  ↓ provides energy for ↓
Career & Learning

Mindfulness
  ↓ supports ↓
Everything (emotional stability, focus)
```

When you see these connections:
- Progress on "foundational" resolutions (health, mindfulness) multiplies impact elsewhere
- Prioritize dependencies appropriately
- Remember: a little health effort helps career progress more than expected

## Fluid, Not Waterfall

This system is **intentionally flexible**:

### When to Shift Tiers

**Move UP (give more effort) when:**
- You finish a dependent resolution
- A deadline approaches
- You feel momentum and energy
- External opportunity appears
- Life circumstances improve

**Move DOWN (reduce effort) when:**
- Major life disruption occurs (work crisis, health issue)
- You're burning out
- A resolution loses relevance
- You're making good progress and it can coast
- Seasonal factors change

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Work Project Deadline**
```
Before:      After:
Immediate:   Immediate:
- Exercise   - Career project
- Reading    - Exercise (for energy)

Secondary:   Secondary:
- Career     - Reading
- Meditation - Meditation
```

**Scenario 2: Major Exercise Progress**
```
Before:      After:
Immediate:   Immediate:
- Exercise   - Reading
- Career     - Career

Maintenance: Maintenance:
- Meditation - Exercise (momentum is built)
             - Meditation
```

## Time Allocation Logic

The tool allocates time based on:

1. **Effort Level** of each resolution
   - Daily commitments: ~60% of time
   - Weekly commitments: ~30% of time
   - Occasional: ~10% of time

2. **Your Focus Area**
   - If health-focused: 30% more time to health resolutions
   - If career-focused: 30% more time to learning/career
   - If balanced: Equal distribution

3. **Dependencies**
   - Foundational resolutions get priority
   - They multiply impact of other efforts

## Example: Turph's Strategy

**Resolutions:**
1. Exercise 3x/week (high effort, daily-ish)
2. Read 24 books/year (medium effort, weekly)
3. Learn Spanish (medium effort, weekly)
4. Meditate daily (high effort, daily)

**Available Time:** 20 hours/week
**Focus Area:** Health & wellness

**Result:**
```
Immediate (8 hours/week):
- Exercise (4 hours) - foundation of health focus
- Meditation (4 hours) - supports everything

Secondary (4.5 hours/week):
- Read (2.5 hours) - good for mindfulness, learning
- Spanish (2 hours) - intellectual stimulation

Maintenance:
- Any overflow

Strategy:
"Strong foundation with health & mindfulness. Build these, 
everything else improves. Reading provides mental rest from 
exercise, Spanish keeps you mentally engaged. As fitness 
builds momentum, you can shift hours to Spanish."
```

## Asking Clarifying Questions

When you use `prioritizeResolutions` with `askFollowUp: true`, Claude generates questions like:

- How much do health improvements impact your energy for other areas?
- Are any of your learning goals connected to your career?
- What would feel like "success" for this month?
- Are there external deadlines affecting availability?

**Use these to:**
- Refine the strategy
- Identify hidden connections
- Set realistic expectations
- Plan seasonal shifts

## How to Use This in Practice

### Initial Setup
```
Ask Claude: "Help me prioritize my resolutions. 
I have 20 hours/week available and I'm focused on health right now. 
Ask me some clarifying questions."
```

### Monthly Check-in
```
Ask Claude: "Let me refocus my resolutions. 
Things have been challenging with [constraint]. 
How should I adjust my prioritization?"
```

### Progress Celebration
```
Ask Claude: "I've been crushing my exercise goal. 
How can I use this momentum for my other resolutions?"
```

### Life Change
```
Ask Claude: "I just got a new job. 
How should I re-prioritize with limited time?"
```

## Key Principles

1. **Progress > Perfection** - Some progress on all resolutions beats perfect on few
2. **Consistency > Intensity** - 15 minutes weekly beats 2 hours monthly
3. **Momentum Matters** - Small wins compound; regression hurts psychology
4. **Dependencies are Real** - Health/mindfulness enable everything else
5. **Flexibility is Feature** - Rigidity fails; adaptation succeeds
6. **Communication Works** - Talking it through with Claude refines strategy

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Trying to give 100% to all resolutions equally
❌ Ignoring maintenance-level resolutions completely
❌ Never adjusting the strategy
❌ Treating it as a rigid waterfall
❌ Forgetting why resolutions matter
✅ Instead: Review quarterly, adjust monthly, celebrate momentum

**Remember:** This isn't about productivity hacking or optimization porn. It's about **sustainable progress on what matters to you**, acknowledging that you're human and life isn't linear.
